      <h2>The Idea Behind Kuronami</h2>
      <p>
        Kuronami Drift Fuel is a concept brand for an energy drink inspired by
        Japanese street racing, night drives and underground culture.

        The goal of this project is to explore how visual identity, product
        storytelling and interface design can work together to create a
        believable, modern beverage brand.
